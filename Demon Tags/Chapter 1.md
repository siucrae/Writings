### Chapter 1: The Floating City

A gradient of blues and reds painted the sky, glowing faintly as the sun dipped below the horizon. Amidst the watercolor tapestry, spires of brass and glass rose like jagged teeth, their surfaces reflecting a mixture of supremacy and oddity. The city hung suspended in the sky, a glittering gem held aloft by the restless, chaotic energy that pulsed through its veins. Beneath its golden surface, hidden depths of pipes and conduits hummed with a cacophonic tune, the lifeblood of innovation and fear intertwined.

Below, the earth was a mosaic of gold and brown, long stalks of wheat swaying gently under a veil of drifting clouds. In the shadow of the grand structure, a smaller district added texture to the landscape. Cobblestone streets wound through rows of modest homes and shops, their facades adorned with glowing runes that flickered like fireflies. The air smelled of ozone and burnt metal, a constant reminder of the alchemical forces that powered daily life. Children darted through the streets, their laughter mingling with the clatter of carts and the occasional burst of magical energy from a nearby workshop.

Amongst the noise of the bustling crowd, laughter echoed from within one of the narrow alleyways between a blacksmith’s forge and a rune-carver’s stall. Beyond the leather draping across the opening, a faint glow lit a small space beyond. Against the far end of the wall, two girls sat upon a rusted bench, their smiles brighter than the dim lantern.

The shorter of the two, her dark boots scuffed and caked with soot, kicked them up onto a table that had seen better days. The boots left a trail of ash on the weathered wood as she leaned back, arms stretched along the back of the rusted bench. A soft jingle sounded as metallic tags clinked against one another at her waist, the silver gleaming faintly in the low light.

“You know, Suka, if we fail tomorrow, at least we’ll have this,” she said, her smile light despite the tension in her words, “Sitting in a dirty alley, smelling like soot and burnt metal. Truly, the pinnacle of luxury.”

Suka’s boots were no better, crusted with dirt and grime, but she kicked them onto a nearby crate, a soft chuckle escaping her, “Speak for yourself. If I fail, I’m blaming you. You’re the one who dragged me into this mess.”

The other girl gasped dramatically with a hand placed upon her chest. “Me? You’re the one who said—” she paused, grinning mischievously, “—and I quote, ‘Hoki! Let’s become the greatest alchemists in Erythraean!’ And then you made me carve runes until my fingers bled!”

Her eyes rolled as she folded her arms, a wry smile tugging at her lips, “Because you kept messing up the symbols. You carved a fire rune backward. Backward. Do you know what happens when you do that?”

Hoki flinched at the memory, but her grin only widened, “It doesn’t explode at least.” 

“No,” She said flatly, “It doesn’t.”

“It only sucked the heat right out of the room. Cracked the table too.”

“And your nose hairs.”,

“Only a little!” Hoki protested, her voice rising in mock indignation, “And it was a valuable learning experience! Now I know not to carve runes backward. See? Progress, Suka”

The two shared a moment of playful silence, both leaning back on the rusted bench as their surroundings seemed to melt away. Suka’s gaze drifted to the subtle glow of the runes etched into her own dog tags—the jewel a deep crimson that matched the worn edges of her patched-up jacket. Beneath the faded fabric, her frame was slender but sturdy, like a willow tree swaying in the wind. Her hands, though calloused, were steady as they traced the runes on her tags, a quiet hum of cacophonic essence vibrating beneath her fingertips.

Hoki is slightly shorter than Suka, her frame more compact but slim with the muscles of someone who worked the forge. Her loose, messy hair framed her face, a tangled mess of copper and yellow strands that partially escaped into a tattered crimson scarf. Centered roughly across her nose was the white blemish of a scar. Her outfit was almost identical in nature to Suka’s, but it was more worn, more lived in, with the familiar stains of someone who had spent their days in the rougher parts of the city—clothes patched with mismatched threads and boots that had seen better days.

Suka's posture is straighter, more reserved—like someone who carried the weight of discipline rather than muscle. Her frame was lean, but there was a quiet strength in the way she held herself, a kind of refined stillness honed by years of precise movement and practiced restraint. Her hair, a natural gray-blue hue that shimmered like slate under moonlight, was neatly combed down past her shoulders, only slightly ruffled. That muted color framed her face with an almost ethereal sharpness, drawing more attention to her eyes—cool, striking blue, clear as polished ice and just as unreadable. 

“You’re impossible,” Suka muttered, shaking her head; her voice fond.

“And yet, here you are, stuck with me,” Hoki chuckled, nudging her shoulder against Suka’s, “Face it, Suka. You’d be lost without me!”

Suka’s expression softened, the corners of her mouth twitching upward, “Lost? Maybe, but at least I’d be well-rested,” she muttered, though the warmth in her voice betrayed the teasing edge.

Hoki’s grin slowly faltered as her gaze shifted to the alley entrance. The distant sounds of the city filtered in through the narrow passage, and the flickering light of the lantern beside them cast fleeting shadows across the worn leather that draped across the entrance. Each tag was in amazing condition, the polished metal not even slightly dulled by years of use—a stigment to her masterful craft.

“Do you think we’re ready? For the exam, I mean,” Hoki asked, her voice softening, uncertainty creeping into her tone.

Suka hesitated, her fingers tightening around her own tags. She studied the faint glow of the runes on them, the hum of the cacophonic essence almost soothing in its familiarity. “If we’re not ready now, we never will be.”

Hoki nodded, though the usual fire in her expression seemed dim for a moment. “Yeah. You’re right. It’s just… what if we’re not good enough? What if they take one look at us and decide we don’t belong there?”

Suka turned to her, pinching her cheeks. Her gaze steady as she met Hoki’s violet eyes, anxiety filling their pits, “Look at me,” Suka’s voice changed to a firm, confident tone, “We belong there as much as anyone else. More, even. Because we’ve worked for it. Because we’ve earned it. And because we’ve got something no one else does.”

Hoki raised an eyebrow, her expression curious. “What’s that?”

Suka smiled, her gaze softening. “Each other.”

Hoki snorted a laugh, tossing her head back and covering her mouth as her unease began to melt away, “Okay, that was cheesy. But I’ll allow it.”

The sudden sound of approaching footsteps caused both of them to glance up. A hand moved the leather drape out of the way, revealing a young boy. His silhouette was framed by the faint glow of the lanterns from the street, his face lit from the lantern inside. He had dark, unruly hair that fell over his forehead and a confident smirk that could rival the capital city’s gleaming spires. His uniform, much like theirs, was a reflection of humble beginnings—slightly rumpled, the hems of his brown coat frayed from wear. A set of battered, metallic tags hung from his neck; each one was embedded with an emerald gemstone that gleamed like a distant star.

“Well, well,” he said, leaning casually against the brick wall with his arms crossed. “If it isn’t the Doro twins. I was wonderin’ where all the noise was comin’ from.”

Hoki straightened, her grin returning. “Kael, shouldn’t you be off somewhere brooding?”

Kael shrugged, a faint blush spreading across his cheeks, “I was, but then I heard laughter. Figured I’d investigate. Y’know, in case someone was in need of some savin’.”

Suka raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “From what? Your ego?”

Kael laughed, his grin never fading, “Yer funny. But really, are y’all two ready for tomorrow?”

Suka and Hoki exchanged a glance before nodding in unison. “As ready as we’ll ever be,” Hoki said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes, “Why? You worried about us?”

Kael’s smirk widened. “Worried? Nah. Just makin’ sure ye don’t embarrass yerselves. The Academy’s got standards, y’know.”

Suka stood, eyes narrowing with a playful challenge, “We’ll see who embarrasses who.”

Kael held up his hands in mock surrender, his smirk growing, “Alright, alright. No need to get defensive. Just remember, when ye’re struggling tomorrow, I’ll be there to bail ye out.”

Hoki shook her head, a laugh escaping her. “You wish, Kael. You wish.”

As the three of them settled back onto the bench, Hoki’s fingers absently traced the runes on her silver tags. “You know,” she said, her voice thoughtful, “it’s weird to think that all of this—the tags, the runes, even the Academy—runs on cacophonic essence. It’s like… the lifeblood of everything.”

Suka nodded, her gaze fixed on the faint glow of her own tags. “It’s chaotic, unpredictable. That’s what makes it so powerful—and so dangerous. They say it’s the raw energy of creation itself, but it’s also what twisted the old world into ruin.”

Kael leaned forward, his emerald tags catching the dim light. “Aye, and that’s why they keep it bound up in these. Without ‘em, the essence would seep into ye, change ye—make ye one of them.”

Hoki frowned, her fingers tightening around her tags. “Then what makes us any different from demons?”

The conversation halted. Silence pricked their ears, the city sound mute the same.

Kael exhaled sharply before forcing a grin that left as soon as it came, his fingers drummed restlessly against the table, “Well, let’s just make sure none of us slip, eh?”

The conversation lulled, the weight of their words settling over them like a heavy blanket. The lantern’s light flickered, casting long shadows across the alley. Hoki yawned, stretching her arms above her head, “Ugh, I’m exhausted. We should probably get some sleep if we’re gonna survive tomorrow.”

Suka nodded, her own weariness creeping in, “Yeah. Big day ahead.”

Kael stood, brushing off his coat, “Alright, I’ll leave you two to it. Don’t stay up too late—ye’ll need yer wits about ye tomorrow.”

Hoki waved him off with a grin, “Don’t worry about us, Kael. We’ll be fine.”

“Aye, I’m sure ye will,” Kael said, his smirk returning, “Good luck, Doro twins. Don’t let the essence bite.”

With that, he turned and disappeared into the night, his footsteps fading into the distant hum of the city.

Hoki leaned back against the bench, her eyes drifting shut, “Do you think we’ll actually make it, Suka? Into the Academy, I mean.”

Suka glanced at her sister, the faint glow of the runes on her tags reflecting in her pale violet eyes, “We’ve come this far, haven’t we? We’ll make it.”

The two of them sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the sounds of the city fading into the background. Finally, Suka stood, offering a hand to Hoki, “Come on. Let’s get some rest. Tomorrow’s gonna be a long day.”

Hoki took her hand, letting Suka pull her to her feet, “Yeah. Let’s hope we don’t blow anything up.”

“Speak for yourself. I’m not the one who set the house on fire.”

“Only a little!” Hoki protested, her laughter echoing through the alley as they made their way to their makeshift bedrolls.

The twins settled into their covers, the faint hum of the cacophonic essence from their tags a quiet reminder of the power they wielded—and the dangers they faced. The alley was quiet now, the town’s noise a distant murmur. Above them, the spires of the Academy loomed, their brass and glass surfaces catching the faint light of the stars.

Hoki smiled, her eyes already closing. “Goodnight, Suka.”

“Goodnight, Hoki.”

  

“How much longer until we’re there?” Hoki asked, her voice tinged with both excitement and exhaustion. She leaned forward, her pale violet eyes scanning the horizon as if the Academy might appear at any moment. Her white hair clung to her forehead in damp strands, and her lips were cracked from the dry air. Despite her weariness, there was a spark in her gaze, a restless energy that refused to be quelled.

“Shut up! You keep asking the same thing, Hoki.” Suka groaned, her shoulders slumping downward. Her tone was sharp, but there was a fondness beneath it. She brushed a hand through her own white hair, identical to her sister’s, though Hoki’s was tied back in a loose braid. “We get there when we get there.”

Hoki pouted, crossing her arms. “Why don’t we just hitch a ride? My feet are killing me.”

“We would still be on a wagon if someone hadn’t opened their big mouth,” Suka shot back, glaring at her sister. “You just had to point out that the driver smelled like rotten eggs.”

“It’s not my fault!” Hoki protested, her voice rising. “I could smell him all the way from the back of the wagon! You would’ve said something too if you weren’t so busy pretending to be all stoic and mature.”

Suka rolled her eyes. “If only we weren’t twins. I could’ve left you at home.”

“Hey!” Hoki swatted her sister’s arm, but a grin tugged at the corners of her mouth. “You’d be lost without me, and you know it.”

Suka didn’t respond, but the faint smile on her lips was answer enough. The two sat in companionable silence for a moment, the tension melting away as they watched the gentle sway of wheat fields around them. The golden stalks stretched as far as the eye could see, their rustling a soothing backdrop to the twins’ banter.

The next morning, the twins arrived in the city. The sun peeked over the horizon, casting a warm glow across the brass structures. The streets buzzed with energy as aspiring alchemists streamed toward the Academy, their tags glinting in the sunlight. The air was thick with anticipation, and the faint hum of Cacophonic Essence seemed to vibrate through the stone beneath their feet.

Suka and Hoki walked side by side, their shoulders brushing as they navigated the crowd. Hoki chattered excitedly, her silver tags catching the light with every step—a stark contrast to the soot-covered tags of the other aspirants. Suka, on the other hand, was quiet, her fingers absently tracing the runes on her crimson tags. The red gemstone embedded in the metal flickered faintly, as if responding to her touch.

“Do you think they’ll make us fight each other?” Hoki asked, her eyes wide with curiosity. “I mean, I’d win, obviously, but it’d still be awkward.”

Suka smirked. “You’d win? That’s cute.”

“Oh, come on,” Hoki said, nudging her sister. “You know I’m faster than you. And smarter.” She paused, her grin widening. “And better-looking.”

“Keep telling yourself that,” Suka chuckled, her tone fond.

The sound of footsteps grew louder until a familiar figure jogged up beside them. His tags were covered in grime, but the emerald gemstone flashed in the light as they swung from his neck.

“Ready to lose, Doro twins?” Kael asked, his trademark grin plastered across his face.

Hoki rolled her eyes, slumping slightly in mock exasperation. “You’re really committed to this whole ‘arrogant rival’ thing, aren’t you?”

Kael shrugged, his grin never wavering. “Someone’s got to keep you on your toes.”

“If by ‘keep us on our toes,’ you mean ‘annoy us to death,’ then mission accomplished,” Suka shot back, her tone dry.

Kael laughed, the sound light and carefree. “You’ll thank me later. When you’re standing in the arena, sweating bullets, you’ll remember my wise words and—”

“Ignore them completely?” Hoki interrupted, raising an eyebrow.

“Exactly,” Kael said, his grin widening. “See? You’re already learning.”

The Academy entrance loomed ahead, its towering gates a testament to the city’s alchemical prowess. The brass archway was etched with intricate runes that pulsed faintly with Cacophonic Essence, and the air around it seemed to hum with power. Students milled about, their uniforms crisp and their tags gleaming, though none stood out quite like Hoki’s silver set.

Suka’s fingers tightened around her rustic tags as they approached the gates. The weight of the moment settled over her, a mix of excitement and anxiety churning in her chest. This was it—the moment they’d been preparing for their entire lives.

Hoki, ever the optimist, seemed to sense her sister’s unease. She bumped her shoulder against Suka’s, her grin softening into a reassuring smile. “We’ve got this, Suka. No matter what happens, we’re in it together.”

Suka nodded, her resolve hardening. “Together.”

Kael, walking a few steps ahead, glanced back at them. “Ye two done with yer heartfelt moment? Because I’m pretty sure the exam’s aboutta start, and I’d hate for ye to miss it.”

Hoki rolled her eyes, but there was no real annoyance in her expression. “You’re insufferable, you know that?”

“So I’ve been told,” Kael said, his grin never faltering. “Now come on. Let’s show these people what we country folk can do.”

The crowd began to move, the students funneling through the gates and into the Academy grounds. Suka, Hoki, and Kael fell into step with the others, their shoulders brushing as they navigated the throng. The three inched their way closer to the entrance, the looming gate growing more menacing with every step. The massive structure seemed to grow taller as they approached, its brass and glass spires piercing the sky like jagged teeth. The runes etched into the archway pulsed faintly, their glow intensifying as if responding to the presence of the aspiring alchemists.

As they crossed the threshold, a wave of energy washed over them, the Cacophonic Essence intensifying. Suka’s tags hummed faintly, the crimson gemstone glowing brighter for a moment before settling back into its usual flicker. Ahead, a giant scripture lay flat on the ground, its surface covered in intricate runes that glowed with a faint, otherworldly light. The air above the plate shimmered, as if the very fabric of reality was bending.

Hoki hesitated, her silver tags catching the unreal light as she glanced at Suka. “Is this… safe?”

Suka’s gaze was fixed on the runes, the gemstones in her tags humming faintly in response. “It’s Cacophonic Essence. Of course it’s not safe. But it’s the only way up.”

Kael, standing beside them, grinned. “What’s the matter, Hoki? Scared of a little teleportation?”

Hoki glared at him, though her hands trembled slightly. “I’m not scared. Just… cautious.”

Suka reached out, her fingers brushing against her sister’s arm. “We’ll be fine.”

Almost as if her words were the activation, the runes on the plate began to glow brighter, their light intensifying in rhythm with the growing hum. A slight twinge of unease danced in Suka’s chest, the world around her dissolving into a blur of colors and shapes. For a moment, she felt weightless, as if she were floating in a sea of light and sound. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the light faded, and the world snapped back into focus.
