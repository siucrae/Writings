# Symbolism in Suka's Design
_A note on Suka Sotiras Doro (Siu)_

---

## Hair

### Blue Hair
- Represents her connection to demon blood and cacophonia.  
- **Blue** signifies strong affinity with cacophony: in tune with the energy, but still raw and unrefined.  

### Hair Turning White + Yellow (possible future)
- Symbolizes the intense buildup and toll of using cacophony.  
- **White** = purity.  
- **Yellow** = impurity.  
- Together: her struggle between purity and the dangerous effects of overuse.

## Eyes

### Yellow Eye
- Represents crystallization of cacophony within her, showing the toll of excessive mana use.  
- **Yellow** = impurity → pushing beyond her natural limits, suffering consequences of overuse.  

### Changing Eye Color
- Transition from **Yellow (impure)** → **White (pure)**.  
- Signifies either:
  - Her increasing control over cacophony, **or**
  - Her body’s response to immense mana usage.  
- Eyes act as a barometer for her connection to cacophony, showing both the toll and her evolving strength.

## Name: **Siucrae Sotiras Doro**

- **Sotiras** → “Savior” → foreshadows her role as savior of the demon race.  
- **Doro** → “Gifted” → emphasizes her inherent abilities, later revealed as Luminar heritage.
