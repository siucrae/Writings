A silver orb glowed brightly amidst a tapestry of purple hues; spires of brass and rose like jagged teeth, their surfaces piercing the soft sight. A beacon against the endless sky, the structure hung heavy—its radiance tainted and edges sharp enough to wound. The chaotic energy beneath its shell seemed to throb restlessly. Pipes and conduits twisted through its veins like grasping roots, their hum sustained through oddity.

The gates of the capital city groaned, their massive iron doors parting like the jaws of a leviathan, eager to devour all who dared approach. The air was thick with the acrid tang of burnt metal and ozone, the scent of alchemy and magic mingling into a heady, oppressive fog. Above, the sky was a bruised tapestry of purples and grays, the sun a faint memory as it dipped below the horizon, leaving the city bathed in the cold, artificial glow of mana-lamps. The spires of the capital rose like jagged teeth, their brass and glass surfaces reflecting the chaos below—a city built on the bones of the oppressed, its beauty a veneer that barely concealed the rot beneath.

Siu stood at the forefront of the rebellion, her silhouette sharp against the flickering light of the city. Her body was a coiled spring, every muscle taut with anticipation, every breath shallow and measured. The weight of the world pressed down on her shoulders, not just the physical burden of the battle to come, but the crushing responsibility of the lives already lost. Each face, each name, each story of those who had fallen on this path of rebellion flashed before her eyes like shards of broken glass, cutting deep into her soul. They were not just memories; they were fuel. A fire burned within her, a conflagration of rage and resolve, kindled by the suffering of the innocent and stoked by the injustice of the empire. It was a fire that would not be extinguished—not until the capital burned to ash.

The air around her crackled with latent mana, the invisible energy swirling like a storm trapped in a bottle. She could feel it in her veins, a pulsing rhythm that matched the frantic beat of her heart. Her fingers twitched, the alchemical tattoos etched into her skin glowing faintly, their light cutting through the gloom like shards of starlight. Each rune was a testament to her mastery, a symbol of the countless hours spent in the shadows, perfecting her craft far from the prying eyes of the empire’s enforcers. Tonight, those runes would not just glow—they would burn.

Behind her, the ranks of the rebellion stood in silence, their breaths held in unison. They were a patchwork army—alchemists with vials of volatile potions strapped to their belts, mages with staves humming with stored mana, and warriors armed with blades forged in secret forges. They were outnumbered, outmatched, and outgunned, but they had one thing the empire did not: Siu. And Siu was a force of nature.

She took a step forward, her boots crunching against the gravel path that led into the heart of the capital. The city loomed before her, its towering spires and glittering mana-lamps a stark contrast to the darkness that clung to the outskirts. It was a city built on the backs of the oppressed, its beauty a facade that hid the rot within. Siu’s jaw tightened as she remembered the faces of those who had been taken—her family, her friends, her mentors. Their voices echoed in her mind, a chorus of whispers urging her forward.

The ground trembled as they advanced, the clash of boots on stone resonating like the sound of war drums, building to a deafening crescendo. Siu’s eyes flickered over her team, each face a reflection of the sacrifices they had made to get here. They had all lost something. Family, friends, a sense of normalcy. But in this moment, they were bound by a singular purpose: to bring down the oppressive government that had stolen so much from them.

Without warning, the first wave of soldiers surged forward, their armor clanging against each other like a chorus of metal. The air was filled with the sharp smell of iron and the sharp tang of sweat. Magic crackled around them, the raw energy of the battle igniting the very atmosphere. Siu’s hand moved instinctively, raising her sword high as she summoned the power that surged within her. She felt the magic pulse through her veins, hot and fierce, like the blood of the earth itself.

Her sword cut through the air, a flash of silver in the darkened sky, and with it came a wave of magic, a ripple of energy that sent the first line of soldiers stumbling back. They were strong, but Siu was stronger. She was the storm that would break the calm, the fury that would sweep away their arrogance.

A soldier lunged at her, his sword raised high, but Siu was faster. With a swift motion, she sidestepped his strike, her blade finding its mark in his side. The sound of steel cutting through flesh was sickening, a wet crunch that echoed in her ears. His body crumpled to the ground, blood spilling from the wound in a grotesque arc. Siu didn’t flinch. She couldn’t afford to.

Another soldier charged, this one armed with a spear. His movements were calculated, his every step measured. But Siu was a blur. Her blade slashed through the air, and the spear was gone, split in two by the force of her magic. The soldier barely had time to react before her sword drove through his chest, the impact sending him flying backward. He hit the ground with a sickening thud, his body twitching in the throes of death.

The sounds of battle filled the air, a symphony of death and destruction. The clash of steel, the screams of the dying, and the crackle of magic all mixed together into a cacophony that made the world feel like it was falling apart. Siu’s heart beat in time with the chaos around her, each pulse pushing her forward, driving her deeper into the fight. There was no room for hesitation. She was a weapon, honed by years of struggle and pain, and now, she was ready to strike.

A spellcaster emerged from the shadows, his hands glowing with arcane energy. He hurled a blast of fire toward Siu, but she was already moving. She raised her hand, the magic flowing from her like a current of lightning. With a flick of her wrist, the fire was diverted, the flames dissipating into the air before they could reach her. She charged forward, her blade cutting through the air as she collided with the spellcaster, her sword plunging into his stomach with a sickening squelch. He gurgled, blood spilling from his mouth as he collapsed at her feet.

The ground was slick with blood now, each step a reminder of the lives lost in this futile struggle. Her comrades fought with the same fury, carving through the enemy lines with ruthless efficiency. They were unstoppable, a force of nature that could not be contained. The soldiers fell one by one, their bodies littering the ground like discarded playthings. The city’s walls, once a symbol of unyielding strength, now seemed to tremble beneath the weight of the rebellion’s fury.

Siu’s movements were a dance of death, a blur of grace and power as she cleaved through her enemies with precision. Every strike, every swing of her blade, was a testament to the blood that had been spilled to get here. She could feel the energy of her comrades pulsing in the air, their magic and their strength merging with her own. Together, they were unstoppable.

The enemy forces began to falter. The soldiers’ once confident strides had turned into hesitant stumbles, their will to fight crumbling in the face of the rebellion’s might. Siu’s team pressed forward, relentless, unyielding. They had the advantage now. Victory was within their grasp.

But as the last of the enemy’s resistance crumbled beneath their feet, the ground trembled once more, a violent shake that sent ripples of fear through the battlefield. Siu’s heart skipped a beat. Something was wrong. She could feel it in the air—the weight of something darker, something more dangerous, closing in.

The air around them grew thick with magic, a cold, unnatural presence creeping through the battle like a shadow. The earth beneath Siu’s feet seemed to crack and groan, as if it were protesting the very presence of whatever was coming.

And then, from above, she saw it. The figure descending from the sky, a blinding silhouette against the darkened heavens. Her blood ran cold as she recognized the figure—pale, pure, and yet so wrong. A creature of perfect white, her skin pale as death’s embrace, glowing with the eerie sheen of a creation twisted from light itself. She was not a soldier. She was a thing borne of agony and sacrifice, an impossible purity born from corruption. Her eyes were like polished stones—cold, calculating, and without a flicker of humanity. She only wore a simple white dress. The Luminar.

She floated above the chaos, her body suspended in a void where gravity seemed to have no say. The form was a haunting contradiction—blinding light, but in the same breath, a presence that felt like something twisted, something wrong. Black pillars erupted from the ground, twisting into jagged shapes with a life of their own. They were like snakes of liquid stone, their surfaces shimmering in a dark, oily sheen. The air hummed with an eerie power, the earth quivering beneath the weight of her magic. The pillars surged forward, solidifying in an instant as they shot through the battle, slicing through the air like living weapons.

Siu’s breath caught in her chest as the world around her twisted into chaos. Her sword was raised, dripping with the blood of the fallen, yet still she advanced—her body moving on instinct, driven by desperation and rage. But the moment her blade met the first pillar, it shattered with a violent crack. The force of it threw her back, her feet skidding across the bloody stones as the very air around her seemed to burn with the fake Luminar’s energy.

The Luminar’s eyes pierced from above, chilling and devoid of mercy. Her pillars moved with the fluidity of liquid, bending and reshaping themselves with unnatural speed. The dark pillars solidified in an instant, twisting and plunging into the fray like giant spears of death.

One of Siu's comrades screamed as a pillar shot through his chest, the sharp edge slicing through his ribs like they were made of paper. The crack of his bones breaking was swallowed by the terrible hum of the pillars. He fell to the ground, his body convulsing as blood poured from his wound, staining the earth beneath him in torrents.

Another pillar shot out like a whip, slicing clean through a man’s midsection, cleaving him in half. His body hit the ground in two distinct pieces, his intestines strewn across the cobblestone in a grotesque fountain of blood and viscera. Siu’s stomach churned, but she couldn’t afford to look away..

The pillars twisted again, and with a sickening thud, one slammed into a woman’s chest, splintering her ribs before the dark mass folded inward, crushing her heart with a single, brutal squeeze. Blood sprayed from her mouth, and the force of the impact sent her body flying, the limbs snapping like brittle twigs under the pressure.

The smell of blood, iron, and burning flesh was thick in the air, and Siu's skin crawled as the sound of screaming and the wet slap of bodies hitting the ground reverberated through her bones. Her heart pounded like war drums, each beat a reminder that the battle was slipping away from her. Her comrades were falling, their bodies torn apart by the relentless power of the black spires. 

And still, the Luminar floated above it all, unscathed, her face like marble—pale and expressionless. She raised her hand, and the pillars began to twist and morph, reaching out with the hunger of beasts. They lashed out like serpents, constricting, twisting, and tearing through the remnants of Siu's team, snuffing out life with an effortless cruelty. Each movement of the Luminar’s hand sent ripples of destruction through the battlefield.

Siu’s breath came in ragged gasps as she fought to stay standing. Her magic surged in her chest, but it felt weak, distant—like a flickering flame that couldn’t hold the weight of the storm she was facing. An onyx slab curved its way towards her, and she swung her blade against its side. Metal clashed against it with a deafening sound, a solid wall of darkness that knocked her off balance.

The ground beneath her cracked open as another pillar shot up from the earth, driving deep into the chest of one of her remaining alleis. His scream was guttural, an awful, desperate sound, as the pillar twisted, the dark stone grinding against bone and muscle, shredding everything in its path. Blood sprayed from the wound in a grotesque arc, drenching the surrounding area, painting everything in deep crimson.

The black pillars, now thick with the blood of her comrades, surged forward, and in a single motion, one of the pillars shot toward Siu’s legs, wrapping around them with the force of a vice. It constricted with brutal strength, squeezing until she felt the bones in her legs splinter and crack under the pressure. She screamed in agony as she crumpled to the ground, blood pooling beneath her in dark rivers. Her vision blurred, and for a brief moment, everything felt distant, like she was fading into oblivion.

Pain shot through her chest as another pillar found its mark, stabbing through her side, the jagged stone cutting through her ribs like a blade through cloth. Her body jerked with the force of it, her blood spilling out in a sickening gush. She tasted copper in her mouth, and her world began to swim, the edges of her consciousness blurring into darkness.

The pain was unbearable. It felt as though her body was being torn apart, like her very soul was being ripped from her skin. Her body spasmed violently, and the world around her seemed to collapse in on itself. With a final, anguished cry, erupted from her back, the torn muscle and shredded skin tearing apart in an explosion of flesh. The blackened object peeled outwards forming a crescent shape– a bloody appendage. A twisted, half-formed creation of agony and fury. The bone cracked and groaned, the muscle stretching and twisting as it tore free from her body in a gruesome display of violence. Blood poured from her back, soaking the earth beneath her in a dark pool.

The Luminar’s eyes widened, a flicker of confusion crossing her pale face as she watched the transformation unfold. But it was too late for her to react.

Siu gritted her teeth, her gaze locking on her sister’s face.  The blood, the tears, the pain, it all blurred together as she swung the bloody wing through the air, the grotesque appendage cutting through the battlefield with the savage fury of a storm. The force of the swing cleaved through a pillar, the raw, jagged edge of her wing cutting through it as though it were made of paper.

Her magic surged like a torrent—wild, untamed, uncontrolled—the blood-slicked wing slashing through the battlefield in a frenzy. The power inside her twisted and raged, tearing through the world around her as if the earth itself were crying out in pain.

And then, at last, the final pillar shattered, her wing slamming into the last vestige of resistance with a bone-shattering crack.

The battlefield fell silent.

Siu stood at the center, her body trembling, blood-soaked and broken, but alive.

And before her, her sister stood—the last remnant of the old world.

The Luminar’s eyes met hers, and for a fleeting moment, the girl before her wasn’t just an enemy. She wasn’t some creature twisted by the horrors of the government, a mere weapon to be destroyed. No. This was Hoki.

The name tore through Siu like a jagged shard of glass, a memory long buried beneath the weight of everything she had endured. Her sister—her family. The person she had once known so well, before all of this. Before the battle. Before the pain. Before the blood.

A silent scream echoed through Siu’s mind, one that she could barely even hear over the thunderous roar of her own heartbeat. She felt it. That pull, that unspoken bond between them, even as the blood of her comrades, of her own body, stained the earth beneath her.

The sight of Hoki’s face, pale and distant, caught in the same struggle Siu had endured for so long, shook her to her core. The way her sister’s golden eyes, now dimmed by pain and death, seemed to reach for her, trying to connect. She saw it—the flicker of recognition. The ghost of a past life shared between them.

For a moment, Siu didn’t see the Luminar at all. She saw the child she had once played with. The girl with the same fire in her eyes, the same innocence that had been stripped from them both. She saw the girl who had once called her name with laughter in her voice. She saw the sister who had once promised to protect her, who had stood by her side through the hardest of times.

But that was all gone now.

Siu's wing, dark and stained with blood, had driven itself deep into Hoki’s chest, the grotesque appendage carving through her flesh like a sickening reminder of everything they had lost. Blood poured from the wound in torrents, painting the ground beneath them in dark pools, and the once-beautiful Luminar's body trembled in pain. Her lips parted in a weak attempt to speak, but all that came was a shallow, gurgling breath, the life slipping from her eyes with each second that passed.

Her sister’s body swayed, caught between the world of the living and the inevitable pull of death. Her gaze slowly became glazed, her smile weak and trembling, a futile effort to hold onto the last remnants of something that no longer existed.

"Siu...," Hoki whispered, barely audible, her voice raspy and broken. A breathless whisper of recognition, the final echo of who they once were. It was too soft, too faint, but Siu heard it as though it had come from a thousand miles away.

The truth crashed into her like a tidal wave. This wasn’t just a battle. This wasn’t just some distant enemy standing in her way. This wasn’t some twisted creature she could destroy and forget. This was her sister—the one she had lost so long ago, before the wars, before the cruelty of the government’s designs had taken their lives and twisted their fates. The sister she had sworn to protect.

But Siu had failed. She had failed her.

Her heart clenched, the pain in her chest a physical ache that mirrored the wound in her back. Blood dripped from her wing, the twisted appendage still lodged inside Hoki’s chest, as if her very soul was connected to that moment. The warmth of Hoki's blood, the thick, sticky sensation of it on her hands, was too much. It weighed her down, a chain around her heart, dragging her deeper into a pit she couldn’t escape. She had already killed her sister once—when the government took her and turned her into this monstrosity. Now, she had killed her again.

Her breath hitched, and the reality of it nearly shattered her. This wasn’t a victory. This wasn’t justice. This was the cruelest form of loss, the deepest betrayal. Siu had always thought she would be the one to die first—she had never considered that she would be the one to take everything from her sister.

"I...I’m sorry," Siu choked out, her voice hoarse and raw, tears welling in her eyes. But they didn’t fall. The tears didn’t have the strength to break free, not in the face of the agony that gripped her. "I never wanted this."

Hoki's smile faltered, her lips trembling as if she wanted to say something, to reassure Siu, but her strength was fading. Her eyes flickered once, a weak glimmer of recognition. For the briefest moment, Siu thought she saw forgiveness in those eyes. A silent plea for the suffering to end, for both of them to be free of the pain they had carried for so long. But it was fleeting, and just as quickly as it appeared, it was gone.

The light that had once burned so brightly in Hoki’s eyes dimmed entirely, her body going limp in Siu's grasp. Her sister's life had ended in her arms.

Siu felt the weight of that death drag her deeper into herself, like the world was sinking into an abyss around her. The blood-streaked wing in her hand felt heavier than ever, as if it were a tangible representation of everything she had lost, everything she had sacrificed. Her sister's blood soaked her hands, soaked her soul, and the weight of that loss would haunt her for the rest of her days.
