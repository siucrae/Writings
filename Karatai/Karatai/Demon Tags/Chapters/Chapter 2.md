“How much longer until we’re there?” Hoki asked, her voice tinged with both excitement and exhaustion. She leaned forward, her pale violet eyes scanning the horizon as if the Academy might appear at any moment. Her white hair clung to her forehead in damp strands, and her lips were cracked from the dry air. Despite her weariness, there was a spark in her gaze, a restless energy that refused to be quelled.

“Shut up! You keep asking the same thing, Hoki.” Suka groaned, her shoulders slumping downward. Her tone was sharp, but there was a fondness beneath it. She brushed a hand through her own white hair, identical to her sister’s, though Hoki’s was tied back in a loose braid. “We get there when we get there.”

Hoki pouted, crossing her arms. “Why don’t we just hitch a ride? My feet are killing me.”

“We would still be on a wagon if someone hadn’t opened their big mouth,” Suka shot back, glaring at her sister. “You just had to point out that the driver smelled like rotten eggs.”

“It’s not my fault!” Hoki protested, her voice rising. “I could smell him all the way from the back of the wagon! You would’ve said something too if you weren’t so busy pretending to be all stoic and mature.”

Suka rolled her eyes. “If only we weren’t twins. I could’ve left you at home.”

“Hey!” Hoki swatted her sister’s arm, but a grin tugged at the corners of her mouth. “You’d be lost without me, and you know it.”

Suka didn’t respond, but the faint smile on her lips was answer enough. The two sat in companionable silence for a moment, the tension melting away as they watched the gentle sway of wheat fields around them. The golden stalks stretched as far as the eye could see, their rustling a soothing backdrop to the twins’ banter.

The next morning, the twins arrived to patch of vast buildings. The sun peeked over the horizon, casting a warm glow across the brass structures. The streets buzzed with energy as aspiring alchemists streamed toward the Academy, their tags glinting in the sunlight. The streets were lined with people in exclamation and joy as the alchemists passed, but few held far back seemingly glaring at the crowd. The air was thick with anticipation, and the faint hum of cacophonic essence seemed to vibrate through the stone beneath their feet.

Suka and Hoki walked in stride, their shoulders brushing as they navigated the dense crowd. Hoki chattered excitedly, her silver tags catching the light with every step—a stark contrast to the soot-covered tags of the vast amount of other aspirants. Suka, on the other hand, was quiet, her fingers absently tracing the runes on her bronze tags. The red gemstone embedded in the metal flickered faintly, as if responding to her touch.

“Do you think they’ll make us fight each other?” Hoki asked, her eyes wide with curiosity, “I mean, I’d win, obviously, but it’d still be awkward.”

A smirk crept across Suka's face, “You’d win? That’s cute.”

“Oh, come on,” Hoki said, nudging her sister, “You know I’m faster than you. And smarter,” She paused, her grin widening, “And better-looking.”

“Keep telling yourself that,” Suka chuckled, her tone fond.

The sound of footsteps grew louder until a familiar figure jogged up beside them. His tags were covered in grime-- similar to that of Suka's-- but the emerald gemstone seemed to glow in the light as the tags swung from his neck.

“Ready to lose, Doro twins?” Kael snickered, his trademark grin plastered across his face.

Hoki rolled her eyes unapologetically, slumping slightly in mock exasperation, “You’re really committed to this whole ‘arrogant rival’ thing, aren’t you?”

Kael shrugged exaggeratively, his grin never wavering, “Someone’s got to keep you on your toes.”

“If by ‘keep us on our toes,’ you mean ‘annoy us to death,’ then mission accomplished,” Suka shot back, her tone dry.

Kael laughed, the sound light and carefree, “You’ll thank me later. When you’re standing in the arena, sweating bullets, you’ll remember my wise words and—”

“Ignore them completely?” Hoki interrupted, raising an eyebrow.

“Exactly,” Kael said, his grin widening, “See? You’re already learning.”

The middle of the city loomed ahead-- The Academy entrance lay there. Its towering gates a testament to the city’s alchemical prowess. The brass archway was etched with intricate, near-indecipherable runes that pulsed faintly with cacophonic essence, and the air around it seemed to hum with power. Students milled about, their uniforms crisp and their tags gleaming, though none stood out quite like Hoki’s silver set.

Suka’s fingers tightened around her rustic tags as they approached the gates. The weight of the moment settled over her, a mix of excitement and anxiety churning in her chest. This was it—the moment they’d been preparing for their entire lives.

Hoki, ever the optimist, seemed to sense her sister’s unease. She bumped her shoulder against Suka’s, her grin softening into a reassuring smile, “We’ve got this, Suka. No matter what happens, we’re in it together.”

Suka nodded silently, her fear not quite quelled.

Kael, walking a few steps ahead, glanced back at them, “Ye two done with yer heartfelt moment? Because I’m pretty sure the exam’s aboutta start, and I’d hate for ye to miss it.”

Hoki rolled her eyes once more, but there was no real annoyance in her expression, “You’re insufferable, you know that?”

“So I’ve been told,” Kael said, his face still bearing a grin, “Now come on. Let’s show these people what we country folk can do.”

The crowd began to move, the students funneling through the gates and into the Academy grounds. Suka, Hoki, and Kael fell into step with the others, their shoulders brushing as they navigated the throng. The three inched their way closer to the entrance, the looming gate growing more menacing with every step. The massive structure seemed to grow taller as they approached, its brass and glass spires piercing the sky like jagged teeth. The runes etched into the archway pulsed faintly, their glow intensifying as if responding to the presence of the aspiring alchemists.

As they crossed the threshold, a wave of energy washed over them, the Cacophonic Essence intensifying. Suka’s tags hummed faintly, the crimson gemstone glowing brighter for a moment before settling back into its usual flicker. Ahead, a giant scripture lay flat on the ground, its surface covered in intricate runes that glowed with a faint, otherworldly light. The air above the plate shimmered, as if the very fabric of reality was bending.

Hoki hesitated, her silver tags catching the unreal light as she glanced at Suka. “Is this… safe?”

Suka’s gaze was fixed on the runes with symbols she couldn't quite understand, the gemstones in her tags humming faintly in response, “It’s cacophonic essence. Of course it’s not safe. But it’s the only way up.”

“What’s the matter, Hoki? Scared of a little teleportation?” Kael strode up beside them.

Hoki glared at him, though her hands trembled slightly, “I’m not scared. Just… cautious.”

Suka reached out, her fingers brushing against her sister’s arm, “We’ll be fine.”

Almost as if her words were the activation, the runes on the plate began to glow brighter, their light intensifying in rhythm with the growing hum. A slight twinge of unease danced in Suka’s chest, the world around her dissolving into a blur of colors and shapes. For a moment, she felt weightless, as if she were floating in a sea of light and sound. Just as suddenly as it began, the light faded, and the world snapped back into focus, a blurry image forming before their eyes.

A courtyard stretched before them, wide as a battlefield and utterly unyielding, its vast, polished stone surface gleaming like obsidian glass in the early morning sun. The light played off the polished tiles in fractured patterns, illuminating runes that had been etched into the stone centuries ago—sigils of protection, containment, and raw, unfiltered power. They were subtle at first glance, almost invisible, but the longer Suka stared, the more they seemed to shift—_move_ even—like echoes caught beneath the surface of water.

The air itself shimmered.

Towering pillars lined the courtyard in strict geometric precision, rising high above like the spines of some long-dead giant, their surfaces carved with intricate, labyrinthine runes that ran in vertical streams from base to crown. These were not merely ornamental; they pulsed with a low, rhythmic glow, each rune pulsing like a heartbeat---steady, ancient, and watching. Every beat of light sent a gentle thrum through the ground, like the temple of a god remembering its name.

Between the pillars, massive archways framed the entrance to the central hall, their curves impossibly smooth, carved from seamless slabs of stone that shimmered with a soft, inner luminescence. It felt less like walking into a building and more like being pulled toward something—drawn into the gravity well of the Academy’s presence.

The moment Suka and Hoki stepped onto the courtyard's blackened stone, the world shifted.

Not metaphorically. _Literally._

The air changed—thickened. The temperature didn’t drop, but it felt colder, denser, charged with an electric pressure that pressed against their skin like an invisible hand. The scent of the courtyard changed too—no longer just rain-slick stone and mountain wind, but something sharper, stranger: ozone and burning incense, alchemical salts and the faint metallic tang of spent magic.

Suka inhaled, and her breath caught halfway down her throat.

It was like stepping into the eye of a storm that had been waiting for them.

The courtyard _hummed._

The vibrations started in her boots, subtle, almost dismissible. But as they moved forward, the sensation climbed up her legs, into her spine, and settled in her chest like a second heartbeat. The stone beneath her feet wasn’t inert—it was _alive_ with latent power, saturated with the chaotic energy that powered every breath of the Academy. It didn’t simply hold power. It _channeled_ it—through the walls, the floor, the sky, and, now, through them.

The group of alchemists began to make their way towards the center of the courtyard where the rest of them stood. Suka's heartbeat pounded harder with each step.

Around them, the sea of fellow aspirants stood in tight clusters as they moved, some silent and wide-eyed, others whispering anxiously among themselves. The diversity of the student body was staggering—robes of every color and cut, expressions ranging from grim focus to barely contained panic. Many clutched their alchemical tags like little talismans. Others kept their eyes fixed forward, refusing to be distracted. No one dared speak too loud amongst this crowd. The entire courtyard existed beneath a dome of tension so taut it felt like a single wrong word might shatter it.

The Academy was not a place for comfort.

It had never been _just_ a school.

It was a crucible—a forge for ambition, a place where power was extracted from pain, and survival was the first lesson carved into every student’s bones. Every building, every corridor, every grain of dust carried the weight of impossible legacy. And now, Suka stood at the threshold of that legacy with her blood roaring in her ears.

Beside her, Hoki grinned like she’d just stepped onto the stage of a grand performance, her nerves not showing in the slightest.

She bounced on the balls of her feet, silver tags clinking softly with each movement, the metallic threads humming faintly with her unique strain of cacophony from her well-forged tags. The sound wasn’t sharp—it was rich and layered, like distant bells ringing through broken glass.

“This place is unreal, Suka,” she murmured, her voice bright with awe. Her wide eyes flicked from spire to pillar, from runes to gates, “I mean, we studied all of this. We've seen the diagrams, read the histories. But standing here? _Feeling_ it? It’s like the air’s _alive_ with cacophony.”

“It is,” Suka replied softly. Her voice didn’t carry far—nothing did in this place. She ran her fingertips along her crimson jewel embedded in her tags before gently brushing the enscryptions written along the bezel; the runes were warm and cool all at once, like coals under ice. “The energy here... it’s everywhere. It’s not just around us. It’s _inside_ us now.”

She wasn’t exaggerating. The Essence that powered the Academy didn’t simply exist—it permeated, invaded. It threaded itself through the nerves, through breath, through thought. It was a sentient storm held in stasis, and right now, it was paying attention.

Watching.

Waiting.

The courtyard itself was a marvel of high alchemy—architecture crafted not with blueprints, but with intent. The surrounding walls rose high and sheer, layered with massive panels of dull brass and volcanic stone. The brass was inscribed with fluid runes that moved in complex cycles, their lines glowing faintly with an iridescent sheen that shifted color depending on how the light struck them. The runes didn’t just _decorate_—they adjusted. Responded. They reacted to presence like the nervous system of a living creature.

Above, the Academy’s spires knifed into the sky, their glass-and-metal surfaces glittering like lightning caught in crystal. They reflected the sun in disorienting patterns, casting kaleidoscopic flares across the courtyard below—flashes of violet, gold, and viridian that danced across faces and walls like playful spirits.

The effect was both dazzling and disorienting.

This was a place of _beauty_, yes—but it was beauty in the way a thunderstorm or wildfire was beautiful. There was danger here, coiled and ready beneath every surface. This was the heart of the Academy—_and the heart did not beat without blood._

Then—

A deafening clang.

The sound rang out like the toll of a colossal bell, vibrating through stone and bone. All conversation ceased. Every head turned as one.

At the far end of the courtyard, the largest gate—towering, seamless, and black as pitch—began to open. Its massive inner workings groaned and hissed with steam and pressure as it parted down the center, revealing a darkness so absolute it seemed to drink in the light around it.

From that shadowed threshold, a single figure emerged.

Tall. Robed. Commanding.

The man moved with measured grace, his deep blue robes stitched with golden runes that shimmered like starlight as he walked. His presence was undeniable, regal without arrogance, calm without warmth. He radiated the weight of authority—the kind that came not from power alone, but from surviving what power demanded.

A hush fell over the aspirants like a blanket.

When he spoke, his voice needed no amplification. It simply _reached_ every ear.

“Welcome, aspirants,” he intoned, each syllable like a key in a lock. “You stand at the threshold of the Gauntlet—the crucible by which we judge whether your ambition is more than noise. Whether your talent is more than trickery. Whether _you_ are more than fragile flesh.”

His gaze swept across them like a blade. “Beyond this gate lies your first trial. You will not be led. You will not be aided. What you find there is yours to confront—and yours to survive.”

A beat of silence.

“Fail,” he said, his voice suddenly quiet, “and you will be escorted from these grounds. You will not be permitted to return.”

He let the words hang. The silence was deafening.

“But succeed… and you will earn the right to begin. _Only_ the right to begin.”

Hoki’s grin returned, wider now, mischief glinting in her eyes. “The Gauntlet,” she whispered. “Sounds dramatic. I’m ready.”

Suka barely acknowledged the comment, her attention locked on the man—and the now-yawning abyss behind him.

The gate had fully opened.

From its threshold, a labyrinthine corridor extended into utter darkness. The walls were seamless, almost fluid, with soft, flickering sconces embedded every few meters. Their fire burned not orange, but blue-white—cold and strange. The air that spilled from the entrance carried a scent that was not of this world. Old stone. Wet copper. Dust from tomes never opened by human hands.

The man raised a single hand.

“The path awaits,” he said. “Enter and be judged.”

Hoki looked over at Suka, her eyes sparking with mischief. Suka nodded, the faintest smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth, her nerves quivering her jaw, “After you, partner.”

The two followed shortly behind the vast majority of the group. The moment they stepped into the labyrinth, the air grew colder, the faint hum of cacophonic essence intensifying. The walls seemed to close in around them, the runes etched into the stone glowing faintly, as if alive. The path ahead was narrow, the flickering light from the sconces casting long, twisting shadows that danced across the walls. The people in front of them seemed to bend out of existence.

Hoki glanced at Suka, her voice low, “Where did everyone go?! Do you think this is some kind of maze? Or are we supposed to fight something?”

Suka's gaze swept the corridor, her fingers brushing against the runes on her tags. “I don’t know. But stay close. Whatever it is, we’ll handle it together.”

As they moved deeper into the labyrinth, the air thickened, the hum of cacophonic essence swelling into an almost unbearable drone. The stone beneath their feet trembled, then sank. A low rumble reverberated through the corridor.

The walls moved.

Grinding stone shrieked against itself as the passage ahead began to collapse inward.

Hoki’s eyes widened. “Uh, Suka? I think we’re supposed to run.”

“Go!”

They bolted. The walls snapped together behind them, sealing off their path with a deafening boom. Runes along the corridor pulsed erratically, their glow flickering in frantic patterns, as if the labyrinth itself had awakened. Hoki’s silver tags vibrated violently, reacting to the dense, chaotic energy in the air. Suka struggled to keep pace, her breath was ragged and uneven.

“This way!” Hoki shouted, swerving violently into a side passage just before the corridor behind them vanished.

The tunnel opened into a vast chamber, the ceiling lost to darkness. In the center, a pedestal stood, cradling a single crystal. Its smooth surface pulsing with an eerie, unnatural light.

Hoki skidded to a stop, her chest heaving. “What the hell is that?”

“I don’t know,” Suka advanced cautiously, eyes fixed on the crystal. Her footsteps were slow but light as she gently planted foot after foot up the small stairwell. Her breath was still rough, but it was slowly returning to normal. Before long, she was within arms reach of the crystal. Suka reached out, curving her fingers downward to graze the surface of the peculiar object. Her fingers slowly reached out until the pad of her middle most finger laid across the side of the crystal. The moment her fingers brushed its surface, the air ignited with energy. The crystal flared to life, casting an unbearable white light. The ground trembled beneath them.

With an ominous hum, glowing figures began to peel away from the darkness—twisting, shifting constructs of raw energy. Their forms flickered between humanoid and monstrous, limbs elongating, fracturing, reforming with every movement.

Hoki froze for a second before a smirk spread across her face, her silver tags radiating a light of their own. “Looks like we’ve got company.”

Suka smirked, mirroring her sister’s confidence as her own, her crimson-embroidered tags surged with power.

Before long, the constructs made the first move. One closest to Hoki lunged toward her, but she reacted instantly, unleashing a burst of light from her tags. The energy crackled through the air, striking the creature dead-on. It shuddered, its form stuttering—then, horrifyingly, it reassembled itself, absorbing the attack like a sponge.

Suka followed swiftly, charging wildly but accurately forward, heat radiating from her tags as embers flickered between her fingers. A moment’s delay—then her magic snapped into being, a wave of fire roaring from her palm. She flew back barely able to keep her eyes open from the immense heat. One construct let out a high-pitched screech as it burst apart, its essence vaporizing into ash.

"I got one!" Suka began to celebrate giving Hoki a big, awkward hug that crushed Hoki's arms against her side.
"Yeah, yeah. We still got another to deal with."

The moment those words left her mouth, the same ominous sound echoed throughout the corridor. A light on either side began to glow in the darkness. An unstable huminoid shape stood within the darkness.

Hoki gasped, her bravado cracking under the building pressure. A tremor in her legs quickly overtook her before she collapsed onto the ground, her silver tag clattering against the stone.

Suka cursed under her breath. “Hoki! Get up—”

A blur of movement smeared across Suka's eyes.

Nothing registered. Simply Hoki’s body was suddenly hurtling across the room. She hit the wall with a sickening crack. Limbs immediately twisted at unnatural angles. Her head lolled forward, silver hair stained dark with blood.

A sharp breath caught in Suka’s throat.

No. No, no, no.

She spun—too slow. A construct was already in front of her. A stone fist drove deep into her stomach.

The sound of cracking rang throughout the chamber.

The world shattered around her as white-hot agony exploded through her ribs. Her feet left the ground as her body began to twist. Air was ripped from her lungs, her vision swimming with spots. She crashed into the cold stone, her body convulsing with pain, and her vision darkening.

Her breath staggered.

The construct loomed over her, its shifting form pulsing like a dying star. Her fingers twitched toward her tags, her arm barely moving—she could barely think straight, let alone use her tags.

It raised its hand.

Suka’s breath hitched. She wasn’t fast enough. She wasn’t—

Something inside her broke. Not a bone, not her will—something deeper.

Glass-like particles surged through the air, raw and unfiltered. It poured into her back like wildfire, burning her veins and lungs from the inside out.

The construct’s hand came down, but it never reached her.

The air ripped apart around her, a shockwave of sheer force and heat tearing through the chamber. Stone shattered. The walls screamed as they split, runes disintegrating under the pressure.

The construct was gone. No trace. Just ash.

Suka exhaled raggedly, her vision swimming, her hands empty—her tags untouched.

Her fingers trembled.

She had used cacophonia. Without the tags.

Her breath hitched, the weight of what she had done pressing against her shattered ribs like an iron vice. The air around her still crackled, distorted, like the very fabric of the world was struggling to mend itself. The scent of scorched stone and burned ozone filled her nose, thick, suffocating. She dropped to her knees, her arms swaying at her sides.

_What did I just do? How is this possible? What's happening? Hoki-_

Her gaze flickered to Hoki, who lay motionless against the far wall. Her sister’s silver hair was matted with blood, her limbs still lay twisted at angles that should be impossible. She tried to move, to pull herself up, but her body refused to obey. Every muscle screamed in protest, every breath a struggle against the weight pressing down on her chest. Her mind raced, fragments of thought colliding like shards of broken glass.

“Hoki,” she croaked, her voice barely above a whisper.

The ground felt distant beneath her, the world tilting as though gravity itself had been unthreaded. Her heartbeat—was it even hers?—pounded, a violent drumbeat in her skull, drowning out the distant ringing of the labyrinth. The edges of her vision blurred, darkness creeping in like ink spilled across parchment.
