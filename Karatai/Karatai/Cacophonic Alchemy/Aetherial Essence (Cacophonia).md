# Cacophonia
_The primal, chaotic essence that fuels all magic._

---

## Overview
- Known as **Aetherial Essence**, Cacophonia flows through all living things and the universe.  
- Comparable to the **philosopher’s stone** in classical alchemy: limitless in potential but inherently chaotic and dangerous.  

---

## Properties
- **Chaotic** → difficult to control naturally.  
- **Universal** → present in every being, though some races (like demons) can interact with it instinctively.  
- **Corruptive** → misuse or overexposure can lead to grotesque mutations, mental strain, or petrification.  

---

## Interactions
- Humans require augmentations to manipulate it:  
  - [[Implanted Runes]]  
  - [[Subdermal Conduits]]  
- Demons, Aphons, and Celestials can harness it naturally to varying degrees.


---

## Cultural Significance
- Often revered or feared depending on society.  
- Central to alchemical orders and magical cults, such as [[Cacophonic Order]].  
- Names in remote regions may shift, e.g., **Aetherial Crystals** refer to Cacophonic formations in distant lands.
