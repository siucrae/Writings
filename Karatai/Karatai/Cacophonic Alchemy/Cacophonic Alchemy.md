# Cacophonic Alchemy
_The grotesque magical system powered by Cacophonia._

---

## Core Essence
- **Cacophonia** → chaotic, untamed force flowing through all life and the cosmos.  
- Comparable to the philosopher’s stone in alchemy — primal, limitless, but destructive.  

---

## Augmentation Process: *Augmentum Es Cacophonia*
Practitioners (Cacophonic Alchemists) undergo body-altering augmentation:  
- [[Implanted Runes]]  
- [[Subdermal Conduits]]  
- [[Cacophonic Grafts]]  

---

## Grotesque Transformation
Alchemists manifest visible mutations:  
- [[Rotten Appendages]]  
- [[Inverted Wounds]]  
- [[Distorted Proportions]]  
- [[Elemental Transformation]]  
- [[Chitinous Growth]]  
- [[Markings]]  

---

## Society’s Response
- Feared and shunned; seen as abominations.  
- Cults & factions:  
  - [[Cacophonic Order]] — reverent, devoted alchemists.  
  - [[Purifiers]] — militant eradicators.  

---

## Demonic Alchemy (Contrast)
- Demons use Cacophonia **naturally** — no augmentation needed.  
- Have innate runes, elemental traits, and natural [[Cacophonic Crystals]].  
- Distinguishes them as instinctive masters of chaos.  

---

## Foreshadowed Consequences
- [[Petrification Prophecy]] — entire regions crystallizing.  
- [[Cacophonic Ascension]] — transcendence through petrification.
