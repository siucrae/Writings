# Implanted Runes
_Runes etched directly into flesh to channel Cacophonia._

---

## Description
- Arcane symbols carved into the alchemist’s skin.  
- Glow faintly when channeling Cacophonic Essence.  
- The most **common** and **beginner-friendly** augmentation.  

---

## Weakness
- Runes are fragile → prone to shattering if too much energy is absorbed.  
- Scarring and burns are frequent side effects.  

---

## Cultural Note
Seen as the “training wheels” of augmentation — temporary and crude compared to conduits or grafts.
