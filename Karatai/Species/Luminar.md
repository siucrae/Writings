## Overview
- Celestials are **winged, radiant beings**, revered as descendants of the heavens themselves.  
- Their forms are adorned with **iridescent feathers**, each one forged from **cacophonic essence**.

## Cacophonic Alchemy and Feathers
- Every time a Celestial channels magic, a **diamond-shaped feather** disintegrates.  
- This creates a visible, sacrificial exchange between their power and their body.  
- Feathers serve as both an **aesthetic marker of divinity** and a **barometer of magical strength**.  
* Capable of all types of [[Cacophonic Alchemy]] i.e., [[Biomorphic Alchemy]], [[Chronos Alchemy]], [[Echo Alchemy]], [[Eldritch Alchemy]], [[Nightmare Alchemy]], [[Aberrant Alchemy]]

## Relation to Demons
- Celestials are considered **direct relatives to demons**.  
- Likely they were once the **same species**, diverging through time and circumstance.  
- Their shared root explains their intertwined destinies, yet their roles in myth and culture often oppose one another.

## Symbolism
- **Feathers** → transcendence, divinity, fragility.  
- **Radiance** → purity of cacophonic energy made manifest.  
- **Disintegration of feathers** → cost of wielding divine power, the erosion of one’s being in pursuit of higher magic.
