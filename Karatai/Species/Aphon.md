# Aphon
_A unique subdivision of demons considered half-demon._

---

## Overview
- Any race mixed with demonic blood is considered an **Aphon**.  
- This hybrid origin distinguishes them from both full demons and their non-demon ancestors.  

---

## Biology
- Aphons develop an **additional organ** capable of absorbing **cacophonic energy** without external modifications.  
- This makes them unusually resilient compared to other hybrids.  

---

## Relation to Demons
- **Demons** are the only race directly capable of **cacophonic alchemy** without modifications.  
- Aphons sit in-between:  
  - More capable than ordinary races.  
  - Less innately powerful than pure demons.  

---

## Cultural Role
- Viewed with ambiguity: not fully demon, not fully “other.”  
- Their dual nature often makes them outsiders, but also gives them unique symbolic or practical roles within demon society.
