# Humans
_Mortals with no natural affinity for Cacophonia._

---

## Overview
- Humans are one of the most widespread races.  
- Unlike [[Demon]], they lack any innate connection to [[Aetherial Essence (Cacophonia)]].  
- This limitation forces them to rely on **artificial augmentations** to interact with chaotic essence.  

---

## Use of Cacophonic Alchemy
- Humans **cannot** perform Cacophonic Alchemy without modification.  
- Depend on:  
  - [[Implanted Runes]]  
  - [[Subdermal Conduits]]  
  - [[Cacophonic Grafts]]  
  - Specialized tools and artificed devices.  

---

## Advantages
- Humans’ flexibility makes them some of the most **innovative alchemists**, creating methods to survive what demons do instinctively.  
- Many infamous [[Cacophonic Order]] members are human pioneers who pushed augmentation to grotesque extremes.  

---

## Disadvantages
- Heavy dependence on external modifications → constant risk of failure or rejection.  
- Shorter lifespans when practicing Cacophonic Alchemy compared to demons or hybrids.  

---

## Cultural Perception
- Seen as fragile and unfit by demons.  
- Feared or mistrusted by their own kin if visibly augmented.  
- In many human societies, **augmentors** are both revered as geniuses and reviled as abominations.
