Chapter 3: Bound in Silence

Suka woke to sterile light pressing against her closed eyelids. A hum filled the air, steady, rhythmic, mechanical. The scent of antiseptic burned her nostrils, a sharp contrast to the scorched stone and burnt ozone that had filled her lungs before.

Her fingers twitched against something cold. Metal. Restraints.

Panic surged through her veins, her body lurching forward—only for her wrists to be yanked back by unseen forces. Chains rattled against the frame of the medical bed, the weight of confinement sinking in like iron pressed against her bones.

She opened her eyes.

The room was white. Too white. It gleamed under the artificial light, sterile and unforgiving. The walls, smooth and seamless, bore no windows, no markings, no sign of time or place. Strange devices hummed beside her, their screens flickering with unreadable symbols and pulsing lines of data.

A door hissed open.

Suka turned her head, sluggish, her muscles stiff from forced stillness. A figure entered, draped in a high-collared coat, their face obscured by a mask of polished silver. Their movements were slow, measured, deliberate.

"You're awake," the figure noted, their voice a smooth, clinical monotone. They stepped closer, their gloved fingers dancing across the screen of a nearby monitor. "Fascinating. The readings are still unstable."

Suka swallowed, her throat dry, her body trembling despite the oppressive stillness of the room. "Where… am I?" Her voice cracked, hoarse, as though she hadn't spoken in days.

"Somewhere safe." The figure tilted their head, studying her as though she were a specimen under glass. "You're quite the anomaly, you know. Cacophonia without a tag… rare indeed."

Her breath hitched.

Memories flooded back—the trial, the constructs, the overwhelming force that had surged through her, raw and unchecked. She had tapped into something beyond her understanding, beyond her control. 

Suka clenched her jaw, her fingers curling into fists. "Let me go."

The figure chuckled, the sound devoid of warmth. "I'm afraid we can't do that. You are far too valuable now."

Her restraints tightened in response, as if the very air conspired to keep her bound. The hum of the machines deepened, their rhythms shifting, reacting.

Suddenly. a sharp, searing current shot through her veins, forcing a choked gasp from her throat. It felt as though her very essence was being peeled apart, layer by agonizing layer. Her muscles spasmed involuntarily, her vision fracturing as white-hot agony exploded through her nerves. She bit down hard on her lip, suppressing a scream that clawed at the back of her throat.

"Interesting…" the figure mused, tapping something on the monitor. "You’re resilient. But let’s see how far that goes."

The current intensified.

Suka writhed, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The scent of burnt flesh—her own—curled in the sterile air. She squeezed her eyes shut, her mind clawing for any semblance of control, but there was none. Only pain. Only fire coursing through her blood, unraveling her from the inside out.

Small, glass-like shards began to pierce through her skin, nearly white, blemished only by the streaks of her blood. Each fragment was jagged, raw, growing from within her like crystalline tumors.

A fresh wave of agony wracked her body as the masked figure reached for one of the shards. With calculated precision, they snapped it off, tearing it free from her flesh. Suka screamed, her body convulsing against her restraints, blood pooling beneath her as the shard was lifted into the artificial light, examined like a precious gemstone.

And then—Hoki.

Her sister’s name burst into her thoughts like a scream, a raw, gnawing terror overtaking her pain. What had happened to her? Was she here too? Or had they left her broken body back in the labyrinth? The uncertainty was worse than the agony, worse than the chains digging into her wrists.

The masked figure leaned in slightly, their voice dripping with amusement. "You're afraid. Good. Fear will make this much more interesting."

The door hissed open once more, and another figure stepped inside, murmuring something to the masked tormentor. Suka barely registered the words.

The newcomer was unmasked, their expression unreadable beneath the harsh light. They hesitated, just for a moment, before stepping forward and gripping something beside the bed. A scalpel.

"Hey, kid," the man muttered, his voice softer than the masked figure’s, almost regretful. "This will only take a sec. 'Kay?"

Before she could process his words, the scalpel dug beneath one of the larger shards embedded in her arm. White-hot pain exploded through her nerves as he began cutting around the jagged crystal, slicing through flesh and muscle with methodical precision.

Suka shrieked, her vision swimming, her body straining against the chains that held her in place. Blood poured from the gaping wound as the man finally wrenched the shard free. He held it up, examining the way it gleamed in the light, slick with her blood.

"I am sorry about this, alright?" He scratched the back of his head, his tone almost casual, though guilt flickered in his eyes. "Just understand that this is for the betterment of our nation."

Suka gasped, her breath ragged, her body trembling as fresh waves of pain crashed over her. She barely heard him over the roaring in her ears, the unrelenting torment twisting through her nerves.

She was nothing more than a resource to them. A tool to be carved apart.

Time began to blur.

The pain became a constant. A force beyond measure, beyond reason. It surged through her body in relentless waves, sometimes dull, sometimes unbearable, yet never absent. The crystals—sharp and white as bone—pierced through her skin with every surge that forced her to use cacophonia, leaving jagged wounds that refused to close. Her blood stained the table beneath her, crimson pooling against the cold steel.

She lost track of how often she drifted away, her mind retreating into the abyss, only to be dragged back by another jolt, another cut, another agonizing harvest of the crystals growing inside her.

A hand grasped her chin, tilting her head up. Through the haze of exhaustion and pain, she recognized the unmasked man from before. He studied her with something almost akin to pity.

"You're tough, kid. But they’re not gonna stop." His voice was low, barely above a whisper. "Unless—"

Unless what?

Suka's vision swam as she forced her cracked lips to mouth the word: Unless…?

The door opened again, the silver-masked figure returning. Their presence alone made the air feel colder.

"Suka," they addressed her directly for the first time, "You have proven… persistent. And perhaps in turn—useful."

She didn’t respond. She couldn’t.

The figure continued, "We offer you a choice. One final experiment. A test of your abilities. If you succeed, you may earn something rare here. A form of freedom."

Suka's breath stammered. A lie. It had to be. And yet, the alternative was more of this—more agony, more restraint, more helplessness.

She was drowning in the pain, and this was a hand reaching out, no matter how cruel.

She stared blankly.

The masked figure’s voice carried a quiet smile, "A simple fight. Win, and you will gain some freedom. Lose… and you remain a simple harvest."

Suka’s heart pounded, the weight of the offer sinking deep into her bones.

She nodded ever so slightly.

The restraints clicked open, and Suka was dragged to her feet, her legs buckling beneath her. The masked figure and the unmasked man flanked her, their grips firm as they led her down a long, sterile corridor. The walls were lined with doors, each one marked with a glowing rune that pulsed faintly, as if alive.

At the end of the corridor was a massive door, its surface etched with intricate patterns that pulsed with a faint, otherworldly light. The masked figure pressed a hand to the door, and it hissed open, revealing a vast chamber beyond.

The chamber was circular, its walls lined with glowing runes that pulsed in time with the hum of cacophonia. In the center of the room was a raised platform, surrounded by a ring of fire that burned with an unnatural, pale-blue flame. Around the platform stood a dozen figures, their faces obscured by masks, their bodies clad in dark, form-fitting uniforms.

But it was the figures on the platform that caught Suka’s attention.

They were children. Some younger than her, some older, but all of them bore the same haunted look in their eyes. Their bodies were marked with scars and fresh wounds, their skin pale and sickly under the harsh light. And yet, there was a fire in their eyes, a determination that belied their fragile appearances.

These were the Demon Children.

The masked figure stepped forward, their voice echoing through the chamber. "Welcome, Suka Sotiras Doro, to your final test. You will fight alongside your fellow Demon Children. The rules are simple: survive. The last one standing will earn their right to ‘freedom’."

Suka’s heart sank as she realized the truth. This wasn’t a fight for freedom. It was a slaughter. A way to thin the herd, to weed out the weak and leave only the strongest.

The masked figure stepped back, and the ring of fire flared to life, trapping the children on the platform. The other figures in the room began to chant, their voices low and guttural, as if summoning something ancient and terrible.

The children simply stared at each other, their exhaustion radiating from their faces. None of them moved.

“Why would we fight each other?” A voice weakly echoed around the chamber.

Silence seemed to respond, but all of them thought the same thing. What point was there for them to needlessly slaughter one another?

  
  
  

The first child lunged at Suka, their hands glowing with raw Cacophonic Essence. She dodged, her body moving on instinct, but the child was fast. Their hand grazed her arm, and pain exploded through her nerves. Her very essence felt as though it was being torn apart.

She stumbled back, her vision swimming, but there was no time to recover. Another child was on her, their eyes wild with desperation. Suka raised her hands, the runes on her tags flaring to life, but the child was faster. They slammed into her, their weight driving her to the ground.

Suka gasped, her breath coming in ragged gasps as she struggled to push the child off. But the child was relentless, their hands glowing with raw energy as they pressed down on her chest.

And then, suddenly, the child was gone.

Suka looked up to see another child standing over her, their hands glowing with raw Cacophonic Essence. The first child lay on the ground, their body twisted and broken, their eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.

Suka’s heart sank as she realized the truth. This wasn’t a fight for freedom. It was a slaughter. A way to thin the herd, to weed out the weak and leave only the strongest.

The masked figure stepped back, and the ring of fire flared to life, trapping the children on the platform. The other figures in the room began to chant, their voices low and guttural, as if summoning something ancient and terrible.

Suka stood amidst the carnage, her body trembling with exhaustion and pain. The platform was littered with broken bodies, their blood pooling beneath her feet. The other children were gone, their lives snuffed out in a brutal display of power and desperation.

The masked figure stepped forward, their voice echoing through the chamber. "Congratulations, Suka. You have proven yourself worthy."

Suka didn’t respond. She couldn’t. The weight of what she had done—what she had been forced to do—pressed down on her like a physical force.

The masked figure stepped back, and the ring of fire flared to life, trapping the children on the platform. The other figures in the room began to chant, their voices low and guttural, as if summoning something ancient and terrible.

  

The silence was thick, a heavy thing that clung to the air, settling into the spaces between heartbeats. The floor beneath Suka was slick—something warm, something not entirely hers. She had survived. That much, at least, was undeniable. The rest? Uncertain.

The masked figure stepped forward, a shadow in the dim glow of dying embers. Their voice was velvet stretched thin. "You persist. That is... noteworthy."

Suka swayed where she stood, the weight of exhaustion pressing against her ribs, making each breath feel like a debt she would never repay. Somewhere, the scent of burning hair curled into the air, acrid and inescapable. She forced herself to meet their gaze—or what little she could see of it.

"You have earned something rare," they continued, almost amused. "A choice."

A choice. The word rang hollow, brittle in the vastness of this place. Suka's fingers twitched at her sides, nails digging into flesh, grounding her in something tangible. "What... kind of choice?"

A gesture. The flames wavered, the runes on the walls dimming like breath fading against glass. Beyond the ring of scorched stone, the others began to move—efficient, methodical, unbothered by the still-warm bodies they collected. Resources. Nothing more.

"A step forward," the figure said, tilting their head. "Or stagnation."

Another door slid open, revealing a corridor that stretched out like a throat swallowing light. A path. A cage of a different shape.

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you remain as you are. A harvest waiting for the next season."

No hesitation. The ground was unsteady beneath her, her muscles unraveling like thread, but she moved. She moved because the alternative was standing still, and standing still was another way to rot. The figure followed, a quiet specter in her wake. The hallway swallowed them both, the hum of unseen machinery pressing in from all sides, a heartbeat made of metal and wire.

The door at the end was different. It pulsed beneath the figure’s hand, whispering something only they could hear. Then it parted, slow and deliberate, unveiling something that should have felt foreign, yet cracked open something deep inside her.

A sky.

Not quite blue, not quite real, but vast in a way she had forgotten the world could be. The air outside was thin, carrying the ghost of something almost alive, something that did not belong to the sterile hum of walls and whispers.

The figure stepped beside her, their voice a murmur against the wind. "Welcome to the next phase of your existence. Let us see what remains of you."

Then, as if summoned by the very nature of her fraying reality, the world fractured.

Explosions bloomed in the distance, rupturing the quiet with violent force. The ground trembled. The academy groaned, its carefully maintained order crumbling beneath the weight of something long overdue. Shadows moved in the periphery, quick and desperate, voices rising in a language she seemingly couldn’t understand—familiar yet fractured.

The figure turned, their composure unbroken. But they were already too late.

The air cracked apart. A force slammed into her, ripping her from the ledge. The sky tilted, her vision warping as the world rushed away from her. Flipping around from the strong torrent of wind,  the city below yawned wide, distant and indifferent.

The wind screamed silently as the world faded behind ink blotches.
